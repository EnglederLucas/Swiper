# Swiper - Tinder for Movies

## Introduction

Swiper is a React Native App, which tries to solve a simple and relatable Problem. "Which movie are we gonna watch today?"
Our app tries to make this decision easy and fun. You just swipe through movies, deciding based on basic information and trailer, if you're interested.
